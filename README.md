Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily interested in decentralized reputation and web of trust.

Currently building a [nostr desktop client](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good), the purpose of which is to demonstrate decentralized web of trust using the "threaded tapestry" model for decentralized knowledge representation and curation.

Tools include: javascript, node, ipfs, react, jQuery, electron, sqlite3, vis.js, nostr (since Dec 2022), typescript, redux.
