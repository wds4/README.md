Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily interested in decentralized reputation and web of trust.

Tools include javascript, node, typescript, nostr, ipfs, react, jQuery, electron, sqlite3, vis.js. Tools I may be learning soon: [dts](https://weiran-zsd.github.io/dts-cli/) (or something similar), redux.

As of mid-December 2022 I have been incorporating the nostr protocol into my projects. Currently building an electron nostr boilerplate app. Once complete, I will be testing out a few ideas on how to use decentralized ratings and reputation with nostr.
