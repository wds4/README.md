Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily interested in decentralized reputation and web of trust.

Tools include javascript, typescript, jQuery, react, electron, sqlite, vis.js. 

As of mid-December 2022 I have been incorporating the #nostr protocol into my projects. Currently building an electron nostr boilerplate app. Once complete, I will be testing out a few ideas on how to use decentralized ratings and reputation with nostr.
