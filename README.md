Hello world!

My programming interests are focused on decentralized reputation and web of trust. My goals are to create working prototypes of two projects that I call the Grapevine and the Concept Graph. One way to describe the concept graph is that it is a way to organize information that focuses on its format. The notions of a "concept" and data "format" in the concept graph are similar in many ways to the notions of classes and types in javascript/TypeScript. Take the notions of classes and types and generalize them to the whole world, and you have the concept graph.

The Grapevine is a web of trust that is designed to interface with the concept graph.

As of mid-December 2022 I have been incorporating the #nostr protocol into my projects, with my current focus an electron nostr boilerplate app. Once I've polished it up, I will fork this project and add Grapevine and Concept Graph functionality.
