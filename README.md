Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily interested in decentralized reputation and web of trust.

Tools include: javascript, node, ipfs, react, jQuery, electron, sqlite3, vis.js, nostr (since Dec 2022), typescript (learning). May soon be learning: [dts](https://weiran-zsd.github.io/dts-cli/) (or something similar), redux (or something similar).

Currently building a [nostr desktop client](https://github.com/wds4/electron-react-boilerplate-nostr). Once complete, I will be testing out a few ideas on how to use decentralized ratings and reputation with nostr.
