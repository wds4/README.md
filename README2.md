My programming interests are focused on decentralized reputation and web of trust. My goals are to create working prototypes of two projects that I call the Grapevine and the Concept Graph. 

One way to describe the concept graph is that it is a way to organize information that focuses on its format. The notions of a "concept" and data "format" in the concept graph are similar in many ways to the notions of classes and types in javascript/TypeScript. Take the notions of classes and types and generalize them to the whole world, and you have the concept graph.

The Grapevine is a web of trust that is designed around the principles of the concept graph. My thesis is that widespread incorporation of this idea will be a powerful tool for construction of the decentralized web. No need for Alice and Bob to use the same token, or blockchain, or protocol. All they will have to do is to implement some variation of the concept graph.

As of mid-December 2022 I have been incorporating the #nostr protocol into my projects, with my current focus an electron nostr boilerplate app. Once I've polished it up, I will fork this project and add Grapevine and Concept Graph functionality.
